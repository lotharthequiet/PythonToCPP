C++ requires the users specify the specific data type of each variable before it is used. The primary C++ built-in atomic data 
types are: integer (int), floating point (float), double precision floating point (double), Boolean (bool), and character (char). 
There is also a special type which holds a memory location called pointer.

Numeric C++ data types include int for integer, float for floating point, double for double precision floating point.

The standard arithmetic operations, +, -, *, and / are used with optional parentheses to force the order of operations away from normal operator 
precedence.

In Python we can use // to get integer division. In C++, we declare all data types. When two integers are divided in C++, 
the integer portion of the quotient is returned and the fractional portion is removed. i.e. When two integers are divided, integer 
division is used. To get the whole quotient, declaring one of the numbers as a float will convert the entire result into floating point.

Exponentiation in C++ is done using pow() from the cmath library and the remainder (modulo) operator is done with %.

In C++ single quotes are used for the character (char) data type, and double quotes are used for the string data type.
